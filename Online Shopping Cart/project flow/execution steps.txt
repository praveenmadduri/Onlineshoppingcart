execution procedure
-------------------
Backend process:

connect to oracle database.
go to start->run->sqlplus->ok->by entering username and password.
It will be connected to oracle database.
create a new user for your project.
sql>create user username identified by password;
sql>grant dba to username;
sql>connect username/password;
sql>select * from tab;
no rows are selected bcoz it is the new user of our project.
then minimize sqlplus.
Go to start->run->imp.exe->ok->a window opens
Enter username and password what you created for your project.
It will ask to import the dump file(i.e.,database).Data base will be in project,open it and copy the dump file and paste on desktop.
Drag and drop the dump file in to the imp.exe command prompt.
Remove the double quotes.
It asks buffer size->enter(it takes default buffer size).
import files only---->no->enter.
ignore errors-------->yes->enter.
import grants-------->yes->enter.
import table data---->yes->enter.
import entire export files------>yes->enter.
The tables will be imported and automatically the imp.exe command prompt closes.
Again go to sqlplus
sql>select * from tab;
tables will be displayed.
sql>select * from userdetails/logindetails;
sql>desc userdetails/logindetails;
sql>select loginid,password,logintype from userdetails;
